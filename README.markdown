# FavRatio

FavRatio is intended to be two things:

1. A Twitter "favorites" aggregator site with features other sites don't have, such as FavWeight.
1. A way to learn about the Twitter API as well as the community that uses Twitter's "favorite" feature through the use of a freely-available open source application.

FavRatio is different to other fav aggregators. This is explained in detail in [http://trac.favratio.com/wiki/FavRatio this wiki].

# Django vs. Ruby on Rails

As of 5/18/2012 the live [http://favratio.com/ FavRatio] site runs on Django, and its source code can be browsed by following the "code" link from the FavRatio home page's sidebar.

This GitHub repository hosts the from-scratch rewrite of FavRatio in Ruby on Rails.
