Is crawl() in the right place (TwitterUser controller, but creates tweets and favs)? If it were in the TwitterUser model instead, would that be poor design?

Where would I put the master crawl() method...the one that crawls all targets?

Are the data models set up correctly?
  Want the ability to query TwitterUser.favs_earned and favs_given.
  Tweet.fav.faver is a TwitterUser
  Tweet.author is a TwitterUser

How and at what level should I handle exceptions thrown by Twitter module (rate limit, FailWhale, etc.)?

Is there a good way to set up tests that don't require interaction with Twitter?

Best way to incorporate OAuth-credentialed requests?
  Some kind of wrapper for all calls to Twitter module?
  How/where to store credentials to keep them out of repo? File format?
